The integrated threat theory (ITT) has been utilized to develop issues about rudeness and moral implications in COVID-19-related Twitter dialogue (Kim et al, 2021).\nResearch Design\nThe authors brought the English-speaking United States (US) through three stages: (1) early diagnosis of COVID-19 in China, (2) high COVID-19 death rates in the United States, and (3) news that a vaccine will be available in the U.S shortly. They gathered tweets and retweets from Twitter users (Kim et al, 2021).\nFindings\nThe authors discovered substantial disparities in disrespectful tweets written in cities with higher hate crimes against Asians than in low-level areas. Finally, while describing China and its culture and population, English-speaking Twitter users preferred to employ moral virtues and moral evils (Kim et al, 2021).\nCritique of figures\nThe limitations of this study are as follows: First, it’s a figure 1 that shows a step-by-step change, but it’s not clear which city it’s targeting or specific information about it because we used Twitter data. In addition, the authors did not collect information from all cities in the United States. In addition, it seems necessary to cover more sample cities with more diverse search keywords, including future researchers, to investigate the link between disrespect and actual aggressive behavior on social media (Kim et al, 2021). Also, in order to identify the interaction between tweets, it is thought that other variables may be included to generate more interesting visualizations. This, in turn, indicates the need for further research to supplement the data. In other words, there is a limit to generalization.\n\nReferences\nKim, B., Cooks, E., & Kim, S.K. (2021, August 26).
