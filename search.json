    "text": "Seongdeok Oh is a currently doctoral student at the University of Texas at Dallas, specializing in Public and Nonprofit Management. He has a diverse educational background, with a Bachelor’s degree in Public Administration and a dual Bachelor’s degree in Journalism & Mass Communication from Korea University in South Korea, as well as a Master’s degree in Public Policy from the same institution. Before coming to UTD, he was a researcher in Institute of Governmental Studies at Korea University.\nSeongdeok Oh’s research interests revolve around Public Management, Organizational Behavior and Theory in the Public Sector, Performance Management, Performance Information Use, Collaborative Public Management, Co-production, Citizen Participation, Science and Technology Policy Process, Policy Implementation and Evaluation.\nHe has published several articles, including “From the Chinese Exclusion Act to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Historical Analysis of Racism Experienced by Asian Americans in the United States” and “An Empirical Study of Organizational Factors Influencing Performance Information Use Based on the Perception of Employees in Government-Funded Science and Technology Research Institutes.” He has also presented papers at various academic conferences, including the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) 2023 Annual Conference.\nCurrently, Seongdeok’s research focuses on the critical intersection of innovative behavior and organizational performance in the public sector. Specifically, the research explores questions such as how public organizations can foster an environment that encourages innovative behavior among employees to improve organizational performance, and how public service motivation (PSM) and organizational culture moderate this impact. Additionally, Seongdeok investigates how promoting transformational leadership can enhance innovative behavior in the public sector and ultimately improve organizational performance. These research questions have been influenced by Seongdeok’s previous experiences in research and professional work.\nSeongdeok Oh is eager to continue the academic journey in the Public and Nonprofit Management doctoral program at the UTD. Upon completing his doctoral program, he aspires to become a professor, conduct organizational theory and behavior research in the public field, teach public values, and contribute to building an inclusive society."

This study aims to explore the impact of new technologies on our public life and administration in the era of digital transformation, examine the role of the government in this process, and assess the potential for a shift towards a new governance paradigm.\n\nStatus: Funded\nProject Title: The Improvement of the Effectiveness of the Educational Administration Audit\nFunding Agency: Ministry of Education, Republic of Korea.\nPrincipal Investigator: Kwang-ho Sim\nCollaborators: Cheouljoo Lee & Seonghoon Choi\nRole: Researcher\n\nTasks included literature review, case studies, survey data collection and quantitative analysis.\n\nAmount: KRW ₩70,000,000 (Approximately $55,000)\nPeriod: July 2020 – July 2021\n\nDespite ongoing educational administration audits, recurring findings and corruption persist. We propose a new paradigm to proactively address these issues, focusing on identifying root causes, providing targeted education, and strengthening risk management. Our approach aims to eliminate repeated corruption in education, suggesting policy alternatives, inducing system improvements, and leveraging the expertise of the Ministry of Education’s audit bodies for enhanced effectiveness.\n\nStatus: Funded\nProject Title: The ‘Decoupling’ Experienced by Employees of Public Research Institute in the Use of Performance Information\nFunding Agency: Korea University Graduate School, Republic of Korea.\nPrincipal Investigator: Seongdeok Oh\n\nTasks as a Researcher (PI) included literature review, interviews, grounded theory approach, analysis, draft and final report.\n\nAmount: KRW ₩3,000,000 (Approximately $2,500)\nPeriod: July 2019 – July 2020\n\nThis study delves into the decoupling phenomenon within public research institutes, examining the gap between performance creation and its actual utilization in processes like performance planning, measurement, evaluation, and utilization. Using a grounded theory paradigm analysis model, we explore the structural relationship between the performance management system and the behaviors of institute members. This exploratory, descriptive study aims to identify key themes in the decoupling phenomenon, offering insights into how public research institute members utilize performance information.\n\nStatus: Funded\nProject Title: Organizational Diagnosis of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy: Changing the Policy Environment and Seeking the Ideal Direction\nFunding Agency: Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Republic of Korea.\nPrincipal Investigator: Sangwook Park\nCollaborators: Jiung Yoon, Illhwan Jung, Bomi Kim, & Myeongrok Do.\nRole: Researcher\n\nTasks included analysis of organization, foreign countries case studies, supporting interview, and drafting of final report.\n\nAmount: KRW ₩80,000,000 (Approximately $60,000)\nPeriod: January – June 2019\n\nIn South Korea’s 4th industrial revolution, a shift towards a post-chasing strategy focusing on disruptive innovation and new industry creation is crucial. Fostering a private sector innovation ecosystem is vital to succeed, and the government must adapt proactively to changing policy demands, enhancing agility for survival. The country’s industrial technology policy should evolve into a comprehensive system emphasizing the linkage between research, innovation, and production. Organizational restructuring is also needed to bridge the gap between research and industrial policies. This study aims to analyze policy demand changes, propose improved strategies in industry, energy, trade, and information communication technology, and suggest optimal organizational structures.\n\nStatus: Funded\nProject Title: Survey on University R&D Management and its Policy Implications\nFunding Agency: Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning (KISTEP) , Republic of Korea.\nPrincipal Investigator: Sangwook Park\nCollaborators: Jongbok Park, Gyeongjun Oh, Sangun Yoo, Wontae Ko, & Geonhui Kim.\nRole: Researcher\n\nTasks included literature review, data collection, survey quantitative analysis, and drafting final report.\n\nAmount: KRW ₩50,000,000 (Approximately $40,000)\nPeriod: August - December 2018\n\nThe research aims to analyze the current state and challenges of research administration and support services, focusing on understanding the needs of on-site researchers. It also seeks to strengthen industry-academic cooperation units, improve the relationship between universities and industrial complexes, and enhance the administrative efficiency and well-being of student researchers. The overarching goal is to advance and streamline research administration practices for a more effective and supportive ecosystem.\n\nStatus: Funded\nProject Title: The Practical Method of Regulatory Consultation for Improving Policy Effectiveness\nFunding Agency: Korea Institute of Public Administration (KIPA), Republic of Korea.\nPrincipal Investigator: Minho Lee\nCollaborators: Shin Kim, Jaeho Eun, Jinsik Choi, Myongjin Kim, &Yujin Choi.\nRole: Research Assistant\n\nTasks included literature review and foreign countries case studies.\n\nPeriod: November - December 2018\n\nThis project uniquely focuses on overcoming obstacles that hinder the expansion of regulatory consensus in the current policy process, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of regulatory consensus. It aims to define and develop tailored mechanisms at each stage, considering stakeholder and public involvement, and strategically selecting consensus-building approaches. Additionally, the research seeks to institutionalize the principles of social value and consensus advocated by the current administration in the regulatory reform process, promoting societal participation and dialogue.\n\nStatus: Funded\nProject Title: A Study on the Types of Use and Factors Influencing the Use of Performance Information in Public Research Institutions: Focusing on Government-funded Research Institutes in the Science and Technology Sector\nFunding Agency: Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning (KISTEP) , Republic of Korea.\nPrincipal Investigator: Seongdeok Oh\n\nTasks as a Researcher (PI) included literature review, survey design, data collection, survey quantitative analysis, and drafting final report.\n\nAmount: KRW ₩2,000,000 (Approximately $1,500)\nPeriod: July - December 2017\n\nThis project explores the use of performance information in South Korean science and technology governmental research institutions.

Given deficiencies in the current audit system and independence within education offices, the research focuses on consolidating and analyzing audit results, identifying policy errors, and developing a model to enhance the independence and professionalism of educational and cultural affairs audits.\n\nStatus: Funded\nProject Title: Evaluation of the Government-Funded Research Institutes Under Ministry of Science and ICT\nFunding Agency: Ministry of Science and ICT, Republic of Korea.\nPrincipal Investigator: Juho Lee\nCollaborators: Jihyun Seo, Seungtae Kim, Researcher Taeyun Kim, Namhyo Kim, & Suhyeon Chung.\nRole: Researcher\n\nTasks included supporting performance measurement, evaluation, editing and drafting final reports.\n\nAmount: KRW ₩500,000,000 (Approximately $430,000)\nPeriod: January 2015 - December 2016\n\nThis project aims to assess the management performance and research outcomes of participating research institutions to improve the efficiency of research and development investments.
