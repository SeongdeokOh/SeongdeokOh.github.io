    "text": "Seongdeok Oh is a currently doctoral student at the University of Texas at Dallas, specializing in Public and Nonprofit Management. He has a diverse educational background, with a Bachelor’s degree in Public Administration and a dual Bachelor’s degree in Journalism & Mass Communication from Korea University in South Korea, as well as a Master’s degree in Public Policy from the same institution. Before coming to UTD, he was a researcher in Institute of Governmental Studies at Korea University.\nSeongdeok Oh’s research interests revolve around Public Management, Organizational Behavior and Theory in the Public Sector, Performance Management, Performance Information Use, Collaborative Public Management, Co-production, Citizen Participation, Science and Technology Policy Process, Policy Implementation and Evaluation.\nHe has published several articles, including “From the Chinese Exclusion Act to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Historical Analysis of Racism Experienced by Asian Americans in the United States” and “An Empirical Study of Organizational Factors Influencing Performance Information Use Based on the Perception of Employees in Government-Funded Science and Technology Research Institutes.” He has also presented papers at various academic conferences, including the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) 2023 Annual Conference.\nCurrently, Seongdeok’s research focuses on the critical intersection of innovative behavior and organizational performance in the public sector. Specifically, the research explores questions such as how public organizations can foster an environment that encourages innovative behavior among employees to improve organizational performance, and how public service motivation (PSM) and organizational culture moderate this impact. Additionally, Seongdeok investigates how promoting transformational leadership can enhance innovative behavior in the public sector and ultimately improve organizational performance. These research questions have been influenced by Seongdeok’s previous experiences in research and professional work.\nSeongdeok Oh is eager to continue the academic journey in the Public and Nonprofit Management doctoral program at the UTD.

We propose a new paradigm to proactively address these issues, focusing on identifying root causes, providing targeted education, and strengthening risk management. Our approach aims to eliminate repeated corruption in education, suggesting policy alternatives, inducing system improvements, and leveraging the expertise of the Ministry of Education’s audit bodies for enhanced effectiveness.\n\nStatus: Funded\nProject Title: The ‘Decoupling’ Experienced by Employees of Public Research Institute in the Use of Performance Information\nFunding Agency: Korea University Graduate School, Republic of Korea.\nPrincipal Investigator: Seongdeok Oh\n\nTasks as a Researcher (PI) included literature review, interviews, grounded theory approach, analysis, draft and final report.\n\nAmount: KRW ₩3,000,000 (Approximately $2,500)\nPeriod: July 2019 – July 2020\n\nThis study delves into the decoupling phenomenon within public research institutes, examining the gap between performance creation and its actual utilization in processes like performance planning, measurement, evaluation, and utilization.

Fostering a private sector innovation ecosystem is vital to succeed, and the government must adapt proactively to changing policy demands, enhancing agility for survival. The country’s industrial technology policy should evolve into a comprehensive system emphasizing the linkage between research, innovation, and production. Organizational restructuring is also needed to bridge the gap between research and industrial policies. This study aims to analyze policy demand changes, propose improved strategies in industry, energy, trade, and information communication technology, and suggest optimal organizational structures.\n\nStatus: Funded\nProject Title: Survey on University R&D Management and its Policy Implications\nFunding Agency: Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning (KISTEP) , Republic of Korea.\nPrincipal Investigator: Sangwook Park\nCollaborators: Jongbok Park, Gyeongjun Oh, Sangun Yoo, Wontae Ko, & Geonhui Kim.\nRole: Researcher\n\nTasks included literature review, data collection, survey quantitative analysis, and drafting final report.\n\nAmount: KRW ₩50,000,000 (Approximately $40,000)\nPeriod: August - December 2018\n\nThe research aims to analyze the current state and challenges of research administration and support services, focusing on understanding the needs of on-site researchers.
