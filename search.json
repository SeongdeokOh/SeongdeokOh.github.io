    "text": "Seongdeok Oh is a currently doctoral student at the University of Texas at Dallas, specializing in Public and Nonprofit Management. He has a diverse educational background, with a Bachelor’s degree in Public Administration and a dual Bachelor’s degree in Journalism & Mass Communication from Korea University in South Korea, as well as a Master’s degree in Public Policy from the same institution. Before coming to UTD, he was a researcher in Institute of Governmental Studies at Korea University.\nSeongdeok Oh’s research interests revolve around Public Management, Organizational Behavior and Theory in the Public Sector, Performance Management, Performance Information Use, Collaborative Public Management, Co-production, Citizen Participation, Science and Technology Policy Process, Policy Implementation and Evaluation.\nHe has published several articles, including “From the Chinese Exclusion Act to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Historical Analysis of Racism Experienced by Asian Americans in the United States” and “An Empirical Study of Organizational Factors Influencing Performance Information Use Based on the Perception of Employees in Government-Funded Science and Technology Research Institutes.” He has also presented papers at various academic conferences, including the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) 2023 Annual Conference.\nCurrently, Seongdeok’s research focuses on the critical intersection of innovative behavior and organizational performance in the public sector. Specifically, the research explores questions such as how public organizations can foster an environment that encourages innovative behavior among employees to improve organizational performance, and how public service motivation (PSM) and organizational culture moderate this impact. Additionally, Seongdeok investigates how promoting transformational leadership can enhance innovative behavior in the public sector and ultimately improve organizational performance. These research questions have been influenced by Seongdeok’s previous experiences in research and professional work.\nSeongdeok Oh is eager to continue the academic journey in the Public and Nonprofit Management doctoral program at the UTD. Upon completing his doctoral program, he aspires to become a professor, conduct organizational theory and behavior research in the public field, teach public values, and contribute to building an inclusive society."

Specifically, my research agenda involves two main areas. The first focuses on understanding how public employees’ innovative work behavior shapes the generation, implementation, and realization of new ideas within their work environments. The second centers on how public leaders, managers, and employees collectively address both internal and external workplace challenges to cultivate more resilient, transformative, and inclusive public organizations that effectively serve diverse democratic communities.\nI am working with Dr. Meghna Sabharwal on my dissertation, “Navigating the Innovation Landscape: Leadership, Culture, and Engagement in Fostering Innovative Work Behavior for Organizational Success.” I hold a BA in Public Administration and a Master’s in Public Policy from Korea University in South Korea.\nResearch & Teaching Interests:\n\nPublic Management and Leadership, Public Sector Innovation\nOrganizational Theory and Behavior, Human Resource Management\nPerformance Management, Research Design and Quantitative Methods\n\n\n\nContact me\nSeongdeok.Oh@utdallas.edu\nLinkedin\nGoogle Scholar"
